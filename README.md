## Overview

This project was part of my internship at CRTD Technologies, where I developed a recruitment platform. The work mainly revolved around API integration, frontend validation, and building user-friendly interfaces in **Flutter**.

### Key Features:
- **API Integration**: Securely managed user credentials and data retrieval.
- **Frontend Validations**: Enhanced data quality by implementing input checks not covered by backend validations.
- **Profile Page UI**: Designed and connected the profile page with backend APIs for seamless user management.
- **Efficient Storage**: Utilized **SharedPreferences** for smooth, local data storage.
